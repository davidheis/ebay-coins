    <h2>King Carlos I and Queen Amelia of Portugal</h2>

        <br><cite>Carlos I, King of Portugal, half-length portrait, facing slightly left.</cite>
    <p>Carlos I (28 September 1863 – 1 February 1908) known also as the the Diplomat and also as the Martyr, was the King of portugal and the Algraves was born in Lisbon, Portugal, the son of King Luis and Queen Maria Pia of Savoy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel, King of Italy.</p>
    
    <p>Carlos became King on 19 October 1889 and shortly after the 1890 British Ultimatum, or colonial treaties with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that defined African borders along the Zambezi and Congo rivers stabilized the situation in Africa, but it ended Portuguese claims of sovereignty and these agreements were unpopular in Portugal where they were seen as being to the disadvantage of the country.</p>

    <p>Domestically, Portugal was twice declared bankrupt – on 14 June 1892, and again on 10 May 1902 – causing industrial disturbances, socialist and republican antagonism and press criticism of the monarchy. To deal with this crisis, aagainst the will of most political parties, King Carlos Carlos responded in 1907 by appointing Jhoao Franco as prime minister who then quickly established an authoritarian government, which then resulted in the opposition becoming enraged.</p>
    
    <p>Social discontent continued to rise and new ideologies like socialism were emerged and the influence of the Catholic Church in society was declining, and industrialization opened doors to organized labour unions. The republican opposition organised revolts and both the Carbonaria (the armed wing of the Republican Party) and the freemasons conspired against the King. The monarchist parties fought among themselves and made the regime even weaker. During the 21 years of Carlos' reign, Portugal had ten governments, most of them led by left-wing politicians. This all made Portugal a powder keg, just waiting to explode.</p> 
    
    <p>On 1 February 1908 the royal family returned from the palace of Vila Vicosa to Lisbon. They travelled by train to Barreiro and, from there, they took a steamer to cross the Tagus River and disembarked at Cais do Sodre in central Lisbon. On their way to the royal palace, the open carriage with Carlos I and his family passed through the Terreiro do Paco fronting on the river. While crossing the square, shots were fired from the crowd by two republican activists: Alfredo Costa and Manuel Buica.
    </p>
   <p> Buiça, a former army sergeant and sharpshooter, fired five shots from a rifle hidden under his long overcoat. The King was shot in the neck and died immediately, while his heir Crown Prince Luís Filipe died about 20 minutes later after being mortally wounded trying to shoot the murderers of his father. </p>
    
   <p> Prince Luis Filipe brother- Prince Manuel was also shot in the arm as he cleaned the blood off his brother's face. Queen Amelia was close to the gunman, and she stood up and hit him with her bouquet, which had been presented to her only minutes before. This situation caused even more confusion but it saved Prince Manuel, from being shot by other assassins. During the chaos, the two murderers were killed by the police but also many accomplices were able to escape.   
    After the regicide, something changed in Portugal. As the atmosphere became more explosive, Queen Amelia and her son were driven in closed cars to the funeral. Thousands of condolences arrived from all Europe. Most monarchs in Europe were not only related to King Carlos but they were also his friends. Edward VII, the British King, was one of them. He attended a Requiem for Carlos and Luis Filipe at the catholic St. James Church in London. It was the first time since the Reformation that a British monarch had attended a Catholic ceremony. </p> 
    <p>Several days later, the younger son, Prince Manuel, was proclaimed King of Portugal; he was the last of the Braganza- Saxe- Coburg and Gotha dynasty and the last king as well with Portugal officially being proclaimed a republic on 5 October 1910. The Portuguese people, however, were never called to vote in a referendum to accept or reject the republican system.</p>
