            </div>
            <div >
                <p>Alfonso XIII (Spanish: Alfonso León Fernando María Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borbón y Habsburgo-Lorena; 17 May 1886 – 28 February 1941) was King of Spain from 1886 until the proclamation of the Second Republic in 1931. Alfonso was monarch from birth as his father, Alfonso XII, had died the previous year. Alfonso's mother, Maria Christina of Austria, served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.</p>
            </div> 
        </div>
        <div >
            <div >
                <p>During Alfonso's reign Spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups, the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants, problems arising from the Rif War and Catalan nationalism. This political and social turbulence that began with the Spanish–American War prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true liberal democracy, which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime. Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera.</p>

                <p>He left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, that was taken like a plebiscite between monarchy or republic. In exile, he retained his claim to the defunct throne until 1941, when he renounced his claim in favour of his third son Juan (whose eldest son, Juan Carlos, did eventually become king when the monarchy was restored) and died six weeks later. Buried in Rome, his remains were not transferred until 1980 to the Pantheon of the Kings in the monastery of El Escorial.</p>

<h2>Spanish peseta</h2>
<div>
    <p>The peseta was the currency of Spain between 1869 and 2002. Along with the French franc, it was also a de facto currency used in Andorra (which had no national currency with legal tender).</p>
<p>The peseta was introduced in 1869 after Spain joined the Latin Monetary Union in 1868. The Spanish Law of June 26, 1864 decreed that in preparation for joining the Latin Monetary Union (set up in 1865), the peseta became a subdivision of the peso with 1 peso duro = 5 pesetas. The peseta replaced the escudo at a rate of 5 pesetas = 1 peso duro = 2 escudos. The peseta was equal to 4.5 grams of silver, or 0.290322 grams of gold, the standard used by all the currencies of the Latin Monetary Union. From 1873, only the gold standard applied.</p>
<p>The political turbulence of the early twentieth century (especially during the years after World War I) caused the monetary union to break up, although it was not until 1927 that it officially ended.</p>
<p>In 1959, Spain became part of the Bretton Woods System, pegging the peseta at a value of 60 pesetas = 1 U.S. dollar. In 1967, the peseta followed the devaluation of the British pound, maintaining the exchange rate of 168 pesetas = 1 pound and establishing a new rate of 70 pesetas = 1 U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The peseta was replaced by the euro in 2002, following the establishment of the euro in 1999. The exchange rate was 1 euro = 166.386 pesetas.</p>

<h2>Spain</h2>
<p>The Spanish State, forming the greater part of the Iberian
Peninsula of southwest Europe, has an area of 195,988 sq. mi.
(504,714 sq. km.).</p> 

<p>It isn't known when man first came to the Iberian Peninsula - the
Altamira caves off the Cantabrian coast approximately 50 miles
west of Santander were fashioned in Paleolithic times. Spain was
a battleground for centuries before it became a united nation, fought
for by Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Celts, Romans, Van-
dals, Visigoths and Moors. Ferdinand and Isabella destroyed the
last Moorish stronghold in 1492, freeing the national energy and
resources for the era of discovery and colonization that would make
Spain the most powerful country in Europe during the 16th century.
After the destruction of the Spanish Armada, 1588, Spain never
again played a major role in European politics. Forcing Ferdinand
to give up his throne and placing him under military guard at Valen-
cay in 1808, Napoleonic France ruled Spain until 1814. When the
monarchy was restored in 1814 it continued, only interrupted by the
short-lived republic of 1873-74, until the exile of Alfonso XlII in 1931 when the Second Republic was established.</p>

<p>Discontent against the mother country increased after 1808
as colonists faced new imperialist policies from Napoleon or
Spanish liberals. The revolutionary movement was established
which resulted in the eventual independence of the Vice-royalties
of New Spain, New Granada and Rio de la Plata within 2 decades.</p>

    <cite>NOTE: The early coinage of Spain is listed by denomination
based on a system of 16 Reales de Plata (silver) = 1 Escudo
(gold). However, in the Constitutionai period from 1808-1850, a
concurrent system was introduced in which 20 Reales de Vellon (billon) = 8 Reales de Plata. This system does not necessarly refer to the composition of the coin itself.
