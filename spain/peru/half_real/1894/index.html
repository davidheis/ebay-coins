<p>The Republic of Guatemala, the northernmost of the five
Central American republics, has an area of 42,042 sq. mi
(108,890 sq. km.) and a population of 10.7 million. Capital: Gua-
temala City. The economy of Guatemala is heavily dependent on
agriculture, however, the country is rich in nickel resources which
are being developed. Coffee, cotton and bananas are exported.</p>

<p>
Guatemala, once the site of an ancient Mayan civilization,
was conquered by Pedro de Alvarado, the resourceful lieutenant
of Cortes who undertook the conquest from Mexico. Cruel but
strategically skillful, he progressed rapidly along the Pacific
coastal lowlands to the highland plain of Quetzaltenango where
the decisive battle for Guatemala was fought. After routing the
Indian forces, he established the city of Guatemala in 1524. The 
Spanish Captaincy-General of Guatemala included all Central
America but Panama. Guatemala declared its independence of
Spain in 1821 and was absorbed into the Mexican empire of
Augustin Iturbide (1822-23). From 1823 to 1839 Guatemala was
a constituent state of the Central American Republic. Upon dis-
olution of that confederation, Guatemala proclaimed itself an
independent republic. Like El Salvador, Guatemala suffered from
internal strife between right-wing, US-backed military govern
ment and leftist indigenous peoples from ca. 1954 to ca. 1997. </p>
