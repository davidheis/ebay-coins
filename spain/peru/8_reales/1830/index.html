<p>These countermarks were introduced by decree of
October 27, 1832 due to the problems encountered with the
larger countermarks of 1828-1830. Pierced or holed coins were
declared not valid but later were countermarked directly over the
hole with Type V or Type VI countermarks and circulated freely.
The latter types exist countermarked on both sides directly
over the hole and are very scarce. These countermarks were
retired in 1834 after the death of Ferdinand VII and replaced
with a similar design showing -Y II - for Isabel II, Type VI. Coins
dated 1835 and later with either Type V countermark should be
considered counterfeit</p>

                <p>Ferdinand VII (Spanish: Fernando VII de Borbón; 14 October 1784 – 29 September 1833) was twice King of Spain: in 1808 and again from 1813 to his death. He was known to his supporters as "the Desired" (el Deseado) and to his detractors as the "Felon King" (el Rey Felón). After being overthrown by Napoleon in 1808 he linked his monarchy to counter-revolution and reactionary policies that produced a deep rift in Spain between his forces on the right and liberals on the left. He reestablished the absolutist monarchy and rejected the liberal constitution of 1812. He suppressed the liberal press 1814–33 and jailed many of its editors and writers. Under his rule, Spain lost nearly all of its American possessions, and the country entered into civil war on his death.</p>

                <p>Ferdinand was ostensibly the eldest surviving child of Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma. Ferdinand was born in the palace of El Escorial near Madrid. The Queen's confessor Fray Juan Almaraz wrote in his last will that she admitted in articulo mortis that "none, none of her sons and daughters, none was of the legitimate marriage". In his youth Ferdinand occupied the position of an heir apparent who was excluded from all share in government by his parents and their favourite advisor and Prime Minister, Manuel Godoy. National discontent with the government produced a rebellion in 1805. In October 1807, Ferdinand was arrested for his complicity in the El Escorial Conspiracy in which the rebels aimed at securing foreign support from the French Emperor Napoleon. When the conspiracy was discovered, Ferdinand submitted to his parents.</p>

<br><cite>Location of the Philippines</cite>
<p>The Philippines, an archipelago in the western Pacific 500
miles (805 km.) from the southeast coast of Asia, has an area of
500 115,830 sq. mi. (300,000 sq. km.).
Migration to the Philippines began about 30,000 years
ago when land bridges connected the islands with Borneo and
Sumatra. Ferdinand Magellan claimed the islands for Spain in
1521. The first permanent settlement was established by Miguel
de Legazpi at Cebu April 1565. Manila was established in 1572.
A British expedition captured Manila and occupied the Spanish
colony in October 1762, but returned it to Spain by the treaty of
Paris, 1763. Spain held the Philippines despite growing Filipino
nationalism until 1898 when they were ceded to the United
States at the end of the Spanish-American War.</p>
