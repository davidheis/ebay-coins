                <p>Johann Georg II</p>

<p>Johann George II (31 May 1613 – 22 August 1680) was the Elector of Saxony from 1656 to 1680. He belonged to the Albertine line of the House of Wettin.</p>

<p>He was the third (fourth in order of birth) but eldest surviving son of the Elector Johann George I, Elector of Saxony and Magdalene Sybille of Prussia, his second spouse. He succeeded his father as Elector of Saxony when John George I died on 8 October 1656.</p>
<p>In 1657 John George made an arrangement with his three brothers with the object of preventing disputes over their separate territories, and in 1664 he entered into friendly relations with Louis XIV. He received money from the French king, but the existence of a strong anti-French party in Saxony induced him occasionally to respond to the overtures of the emperor Leopold I.</p>

<p>The elector's primary interests were not in politics, but in music and art. He adorned Dresden, which under him became the musical centre of Germany; welcoming foreign musicians and others he gathered around him a large and splendid court, and his capital was the constant scene of musical and other festivals. He commissioned the building of the first opera house, the Opernhaus am Taschenberg.</p>
<p>In 1658 John George was accepted into the Fruitbearing Society, through the patronage of Duke William of Saxe-Weimar.
His enormous expenditure on the arts compelled John George in 1661 to grant greater control over monetary matters to the estates, a step which laid the foundation of the later system of finance in Saxony. Also, his government was less effective in establishing absolutist rule and a standing army than were Bohemia or Prussia.</p>
<p>John George's reign saw the slow economic reconstruction of Saxony after the Thirty Years' War. New trades and manufactures developed, such as textiles, hard coal and glass. Locally mined silver filled the Electorate's empty treasury, and the Leipzig Trade Fair and the Bohemian Exulanten of 1654 also stimulated economic activity.
John George died in Freiberg on 22 August 1680.</p>

<h2>House of Wettin</h2>
<p>
The House of Wettin is a dynasty of German counts, dukes, prince-electors (Kurfürsten) and kings that once ruled the area of today's German states of Saxony, the Saxon part of Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia for more than 800years and took their name from a castle on the Saale near Halle. The family gained prominence in the 10th century as leaders in the German drive to the east, which made Saxony and Lusatia German. It acquired (c.1100) the margravate of Meissen and soon expanded its domains to include most of Saxony and Thuringia. In 1423, Frederick the Warlike of Meissen was granted Saxony and became (1425) elector of Saxony asFrederickI. The Wettin holdings were repeatedly subdivided.</p>
<p>The most important division (1485) established the Ernestine line and the Albertine line, named for Frederick II's sons Ernest and Albert when they ruled the territories jointly.  Although the older, Ernestine branch remained predominant until 1547 and played an important role in the beginnings of the ProtestantReformation, their predominance ended in the Schmalkaldic War, which pitted the Protestant Schmalkaldic League against Emperor Charles V.</p>

<p>Although itself Protestant, the Albertine branch rallied to the Empire's cause; Charles V rewarded them by forcing the Ernestines to sign away their rights to the Electoral title and lands to the Albertines and thus the electoral title and most ofSaxony passed from the Ernestine to the Albertine line.</p>

<p>In 1603 a division of Ernestine lands occurred when Johann III complied with the demand of his deceased elder brother Frederick William I three sons and the duchy of Saxe- Weimar which was then made up of the region around Weimar and the districts of Altenburg, Gotha and Meiningen was split amongst them with his three nephews receiving the main area around Altenburg while Johann III retained the areas around Weimar andJena for himself.</p>   


<h2>Taler</h2>

 <p>German silver DOLLAR. Name derived from the Joachims thaler GULDENGROSCHEN first coined by the counts of Schlick at Joachimsthal, Bohemia, in 1519.
