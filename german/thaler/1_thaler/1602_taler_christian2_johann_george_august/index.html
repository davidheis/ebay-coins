                <p>Saxony has a long history as a duchy, an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire (the Electorate of Saxony), and eventually as a kingdom (the Kingdom of Saxony). Saxony was partitioned 1485 between the brothers Ernst and Albrecht who had been co-regents since 1464. The two new states were first called the Electorate of Saxony (Ernst) and the duchy of Saxony (Albrecht). But the Ernestine line lost the elector title and large parts of its territory to the Albertine line 1547. After that the Ernestine lands were fragmented into numerous small and insignificant duchies through partitions between the different branches of the Ernestine Line.</p>

<p>Christian II was just 9 years old when this coin was minted.  It would appear that it was struck as a show of the future Lutheran rulers of Saxony, having just executed the most senior Calvinist and suppressed that conflict.</p>

                <p>Christian II of Saxony (23 September 1583 – 23 June 1611)  was Elector of Saxony from 1591 to 1611. He was born in Dresden, the eldest son of Christian I of Saxony and Sophie of Brandenburg. He belonged to the Albertine line of the House of Wettin.</p>

                <p>Christian succeeded his father as Elector of Saxony in 1591 at the age of eight. Because of his youth, his kinsman, Duke Frederick William I of Saxe-Weimar, assumed the regency of the Electorate until 1601, when Christian was declared an adult and began to govern.</p>

                <p>During the reign of Christian II a rigid Lutheranism was reintroduced and with it a religious oath.

                Christian’s refusal to join the Union of Auhausen deepened the division between the Protestant German states and eventually contributed to the Thirty Years' War.</p>

                <p>In Dresden, on September 12, 1602, Christian married Hedwig, daughter of the King Frederick II of Denmark. This marriage was childless. He died in Dresden in 1611.

                <p>John George I, Elector of Saxony John George I (German: Johann Georg I) (5 March 1585 – 8 October 1656) was Elector of Saxony from 1611 to 1656
                Born in Dresden, John George was the second son of the Elector Christian I and Sophie of Brandenburg. He belonged to the Albertine line of the House of Wettin.
                                </p>
                <p>John George succeeded to the electorate in 23 June 1611 on the death of his elder brother, Christian II. The geographical position of the Electorate of Saxony rather than her high standing among the German Protestants gave her ruler much importance during the Thirty Years' War. At the beginning of his reign, however, the new elector took up a somewhat detached position. His personal allegiance to Lutheranism was sound, but he liked neither the growing strength of Brandenburg nor the increasing prestige of the Palatinate; the adherence of the other branches of the Saxon ruling house to Protestantism seemed to him to suggest that the head of the Electorate of Saxony should throw his weight into the other scale, and he was prepared to favour the advances of the Habsburgs and the Roman Catholic party</p>

                <br><cite>August of Saxony</cite>
                <p>August of Saxony (7 September 1589, Dresden – 26 December 1615, Naumburg) from the Albertine line of the House of Wettin was Administrator of the diocese of Naumburg-Zeitz</p>
<p>August was the youngest son of the elector Christian I of Saxony (1560–1591) from his marriage to Sophie of Brandenburg (1568–1622), daughter of the elector John George of Brandenburg. His older brothers Christian II and John George I were successively Electors of Saxony. From the latter August received an annual pension of 21,000 florins and the district of Senftenberg.</p>

<p>August graduated from the University of Wittenberg, where Wolfgang Hirschbach had been entrusted the task to guide this young nobleman in his training. During this period he held from the winter semester 1601 until 1606, the position of Rector Magnificus; the academic aspect of this office was performed by a pro-rector.</p>

<p>He married on 1 January 1612 in Dresden to Elisabeth of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1593–1650), daughter of the Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. They had no children.
He died suddenly at the age of 26 in Dresden and was buried in the Freiberg Cathedral

                <p>Public enthusiasm of the Albertine Saxons under Christian II was limited.  His father was a drunk and loved to hunt (a royal pastime), so the family had limited public acceptance to begin with, and then there was the attempted assassination of Christian II and his brother in 1604.  Conflicting contracted obligations by marriage over various lands Juelich immediately cause a war which pitted ernestines against albertines, and involved troops from Brandenburg, France, and Netherlands, which did not end until 1610 (The Jülich-Klevisch Inheritance War).  But in the end, in 1610, the Emperor gave a number of lands to Christian II, including ernestine lands, but Christian II died shortly thereafter, unable to enjoy his gains.</p>

<p>His brother, pictured reverse, Johann Georg I, would assume the reign of the electorate upon the death of Christian II in 1611.  The youngest son, August, received an annual stipend of 21,000 Gulden, and the administration of the Bishopric of Naumburg.</p>

<p>This coin shows significant edge wear, but its central features are nicely preserved.  The reverse HB mintmark at bottom stands for mint master Hans Biener, who worked at the Chemnitz mint between 1556 and 1604.</p>

<h2>Taler</h2>

 <p>German silver DOLLAR. Name derived from the Joachims thaler GULDENGROSCHEN first coined by the counts of Schlick at Joachimsthal, Bohemia, in 1519. The THALER (GULDENGROSCHEN), first coined at Hall, Tyrol, in 1484, with a gross weight of 31.94 grams 0.939 fine, shrank so that by 1873 when it was discontinued it weighed but 18.4 grams 0.906 fine.</p>

 <h2>Typical Mint in 1600s</h2>

                    <h2>Terms of sale</h2>
                
                <h3>Payment Policy</h3>
                <p>Only PayPal is Accepted. Please pay within 48 hours. If you are bidding on other items, please let me know prior so I can try and ship all items together therefore you save on shipping costs.</p>
                 
                <h3>Shipping Policy</h3>
                <p>My best efforts will be used to ship the items on the next business day after receiving full payment. Unless otherwise specified, I ship all coins in protective sleeves and enclose them in bubble rapped envelopes for added protection. I absorb all material and handling costs in my shipping rates. I ship worldwide and postage costs are flat. I generate shipping labels from PayPal. Please make sure the information is correct with all your required details to ensure a speedy arrival. I ship from Australia and receipt will depend on a range of circumstances pertaining to the method chosen to ship.</p>
                 
                <p>Any Import duties, taxes and charges along with customs requirements are the buyer's responsibility. If unsure please check with your country's customs office to see if there are any additional costs prior to bidding/buying.</p>

                <p>If there are any charges they will be normally collected by the delivering freight (shipping) company or when you pick the item up. Please do not confuse them for my shipping charges. Although it is an extra cost we recommend insurance on items that are over $200 and on any deemed non replaceable.</p>
                 
                <h3>Returns Policy - 100% Satisfaction</h3>
                <p> We endeavour to provide accurate descriptions and details of the items for sale and any opinion of quality is just that - our opinion and we give no warranties either expressed or implied as to our opinion especially respecting grades. This is because grading can vary depending on many factors such as tone color strike blemishes and overall combination of all the before mentioned even between professional graders so please make your own examination from the photos so as to make your own assessment. 
                </p>
                 
                <p>If for whatever reason you are not completely happy with your purchase, please email me with your concerns within 7 days and if they cannot be resolved, and it is in the same condition as it was sent, I will give you a refund of the sale cost of the item.</p>
