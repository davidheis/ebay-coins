                <p>Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria (Graz, October 9, 1586 – September 13, 1632 in Schwaz, Tirol) was the son of Archduke Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria, and the younger brother of Emperor Ferdinand II, father of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Further Austria. He was Bishop of Passau and Strasbourg (until 1625) and Archduke of Further Austria including Tirol.</p>

<p> He was invested as bishop in 1598, as a child, even though he had not been ordained as a priest and became Bishop of Strasbourg in 1607, a post which he held until 1626. From 1609 onwards he fought with his mercenaries in the War of the Jülich succession against Maximilian III, Archduke of Further Austria in Tirol, and 1611 for Rudolf II in Bohemia. In 1614, he financed the construction of the Church of the Jesuit College of Molsheim, inside of which his coat of arms is since prominently displayed.</p>

<p>In 1619 upon the death of his kinsman and former rival, he became governor of Maximilian's inheritance: Further Austria and Tirol, where he attained the position of a sovereign, i.e. Archduke of Further Austria from 1623 to 1630. He had the Custom House and the Jesuit Church be built in Innsbruck. He fought for the Veltlin and defended Tirol against the Swedes in 1632.</p>

<p>With his wife Claudia de' Medici, he became the founder of a sideline of the Habsburg family, which persisted until 1665 - the most recent line of Archdukes of Further Austria.</p>

            <div >
                <p>Hall, a city in the Austrian State of Tyrol  was mentioned for the first time in 1232. And again in 1256 when reference was made to its production of salt. Thanks to its economic importance in 1286 Hall was granted the right to hold a market, in 1303 it has received the municipal law. During the following centuries the salt mines in the neighboring valley Halltal made Hall the central trading-town in Tyrol and outdid even Innsbruck.</p>

<p>In 1477 Archduke Sigmund of Tyrol ordered the transfer of the Mint from Meran to Hall which resulted in Hall's international importance and outstanding reputation. This move was primary influenced due to Archduke Sigmund seeking to profit from trade which was becoming more heavily reliant on coinage for payment rather than bartering and of which there was a shortage of gold guilders in circulation and gold mines within his territories to produce additional coinage.</p>

<p>Thus Sigmund derived the plan to mint silver coins ten times the value of the gold guilders and as Hall already on the one hand by the defense wall around the town-centre  protection for the Mint was appropriately assured and on the other hand by the nearby silver-mines in Schwaz, would be able to provide the  silver for minting to which he could also make a profit by way of tariff on the coinage</p>

<p>
In 1486 the first high-quality silver-coin, the Taler, was produced at Hall with in the 16th century technical innovations assured to maintain the exceptional reputation of the Mint. For the first time in 1567 the roller-press coinage was introduced for regular use and replaced the minting by hammer. The new technology was exported via the Segovia Mint in Spain (which formed part of the Habsburg Empire) overseas to South America. However, beside these technical aspects, the Mint in Hall exerted world- wide influence through the "Great Coinage Reform" with its Taler on the currency-systems and consequently on the national economies. In 1806 the mint ceased commercial production and in 1809 the installations of the Mint were dismantled and partly moved to Munich.</p>

                <p>The “mother of all mines”, the silver mine of Schwaz, was the biggest silver mine of the Middle Ages more than 500 years ago and at its peak had more than 11,000 miners working it. In the course of time the silver mine Schwaz became the main silver mine worldwide and was known far beyond its borders in the 15th century.</p>

<p>It began – so the legend goes – in 1409, when the farmhand Gertraud Kandler noticed while looking after the cattle that a bull had uncovered a silver-bearing stone with its horns. Mountain chronicles report that in 1420 these mountains in Falkenstein which were rich had been opened up and lots of foreign mountain people from Bohemia, Saxony and other German states moved to Schwaz.</p>
<p>
At its height during the Middle Ages, it was an important silver mining center, providing mineral wealth for both the Fugger banking family and, through them, for the Austrian emperors. During this period it had a surge of immigration and its population grew to about 20,000 inhabitants making it the second largest city in the Austrian Empire, after  Vienna.</p>



<h2>Taler</h2>

 <p>German silver DOLLAR. Name derived from the Joachims thaler GULDENGROSCHEN first coined by the counts of Schlick at Joachimsthal, Bohemia, in 1519. The THALER (GULDENGROSCHEN), first coined at Hall, Tyrol, in 1484, with a gross weight of 31.94 grams 0.939 fine, shrank so that by 1873 when it was discontinued it weighed but 18.4 grams 0.906 fine.</p>
