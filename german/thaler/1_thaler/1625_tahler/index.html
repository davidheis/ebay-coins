                <h2>Ruler at the time of minting</h2>
                <p>Johann Philipp (Torgau, 25 January 1597 – Altenburg, 1 April 1639), was a duke of Saxe-Altenburg.
He was the eldest (but fourth in order of birth) surviving son of Friedrich Wilhelm I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and Anna Maria of the Palatinate-Neuburg, his second wife.</p>

                <br><cite>Johann Philipp (1597-1639), Herzog von Sachsen-Altenburg</cite>
            </div>
            <div >
                <p>When his father died (1602), Johann Philipp and his younger brothers Frederick, Johann Wilhelm and Friedrich Wilhelm were underage. Because of this, his uncle Johann (more interested in natural sciences and art than politics) took over his guardianship and the regency of his inheritance; but shortly after he took all the duchy of Saxe-Weimar into his own hands.</p>
                <p>The next year (1603), the young prince of Saxe-Weimar demanded his own inheritance, but his uncle Johann opposed this. But finally, both parts made a divisionary treaty of the family lands: Johann Philipp and his brothers took Altenburg and some towns, and Johann retained Weimar and Jena.</p>
<p>Because they were still underage, the regency of his duchy was taken by Christian II, Elector of Saxony (1603–1611) and later by his brother and next Elector, John George I (1611–1618).</p>

<p>In 1618, Johann Philipp, as elder son, was declared adult and assumed the government of the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg. Also, he took over the guardianship of his younger siblings. The four brothers co-ruled the duchy, but two of them died soon after and childless: Frederick, who was killed in action in 1625, and Johann Wilhelm, died in Brieg on 1632.</p>
<p>Johann Philipp and his only surviving brother, Friedrich Wilhelm II, continued as co-rulers; but, in fact, it was Johann Philipp who really assumed the supreme and full control of the government until his death.</p>
<p>In 1613, Johann Philipp was appointed Dean of the University of Leipzig. Also, he was an active member of the Fruitbearing Society.
In 1638, he received the towns of Coburg, Bad Rodach, Römhild, Hildburghausen and Neustadt, according to the divisionary treaty between him and the branch of Saxe-Weimar after the death of the duke John Ernest of Saxe-Eisenach without surviving issue.</p>
<p>Before his death, he made a will, when he declared his daughter the general heiress of the branch of Saxe-Altenburg, only in case of extinction of the male issue of the family. This will later originated a dispute between the branches of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar.
Johann Philipp was succeeded by his younger and only surviving brother, Frederick William II.</p>

<h2>House of Wettin</h2>
<p>
The House of Wettin is a dynasty of German counts, dukes, prince-electors (Kurfürsten) and kings that once ruled the area of today's German states of Saxony, the Saxon part of Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia for more than 800years and took their name from a castle on the Saale near Halle. The family gained prominence in the 10th century as leaders in the German drive to the east, which made Saxony and Lusatia German. It acquired (c.1100) the margravate of Meissen and soon expanded its domains to include most of Saxony and Thuringia. In 1423, Frederick the Warlike of Meissen was granted Saxony and became (1425) elector of Saxony asFrederickI. The Wettin holdings were repeatedly subdivided.</p>
<p>The most important division (1485) established the Ernestine line and the Albertine line, named for Frederick II's sons Ernest and Albert when they ruled the territories jointly.  Although the older, Ernestine branch remained predominant until 1547 and played an important role in the beginnings of the ProtestantReformation, their predominance ended in the Schmalkaldic War, which pitted the Protestant Schmalkaldic League against Emperor Charles V.</p>

<p>Although itself Protestant, the Albertine branch rallied to the Empire's cause; Charles V rewarded them by forcing the Ernestines to sign away their rights to the Electoral title and lands to the Albertines and thus the electoral title and most ofSaxony passed from the Ernestine to the Albertine line.</p>

<p>In 1603 a division of Ernestine lands occurred when Johann III complied with the demand of his deceased elder brother Frederick William I three sons and the duchy of Saxe- Weimar which was then made up of the region around Weimar and the districts of Altenburg, Gotha and Meiningen was split amongst them with his three nephews receiving the main area around Altenburg while Johann III retained the areas around Weimar andJena for himself.</p>   


<h2>Taler</h2>

 <p>German silver DOLLAR. Name derived from the Joachims thaler GULDENGROSCHEN first coined by the counts of Schlick at Joachimsthal, Bohemia, in 1519. The THALER (GULDENGROSCHEN), first coined at Hall, Tyrol, in 1484, with a gross weight of 31.94 grams 0.939 fine, shrank so that by 1873 when it was discontinued it weighed but 18.4 grams 0.906 fine.</p>
