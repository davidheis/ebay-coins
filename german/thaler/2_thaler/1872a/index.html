                <p>John (full name: Johann Nepomuk Maria Joseph Anton Xaver Vincenz Aloys Franz de Paula Stanislaus Bernhard Paul Felix Damasus) (German: Johann; 12 December 1801 – 29 October 1873) was a King of Saxony and a member of the House of Wettin.</p>
<p>He was born in Dresden, the third son of Maximilian, Prince of Saxony—younger son of the Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony—by his first wife, Caroline of Bourbon, Princess of Parma.</p>

<p>John became King of Saxony after the death of his brother Frederick Augustus II on 9 August 1854.</p>
<p>The Judiciary Organization of 1855, the extension of the railroad network, the introduction of the freedom of trade are attributed mainly to his suggestion and promotion. Under his government, came the acceptance of the French Commercial Treaty (1862) and the acknowledgment of a contract with Italy. He exerted himself under influence of his minister Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust for the Great Germany Solution (de: Großdeutsche Lösung) of the imperial arrangement (under inclusion of Austria). In 1866 Saxony fought on the Austrian side in the Austro-Prussian War. Finally, after the defeat of the Battle of Königgrätz, Saxony joined the North German Confederation and in 1871 the German Empire under the hegemony of the Kingdom of Prussia. The King died two years later, aged seventy-one.</p>
<p>Beyond his political work, Johann was busy with literature. Under the pseudonym Philalethes he translated to German the Dante's Divine Comedy; some parts of this work were placed in the Schloss Weesenstein. The Dresden district of Johannstadt was named after him.</p>

<h2>SAXONY-ALBERTINE</h2>
<cite>(Sachsen-Albertinische Linie)</cite>

<p>The younger of the two branches of the Billung
dynasty, which ruled in Upper Saxony and Meissen, this line
founded by Friedrich II's son, Albrecht, in 1485, first ruled in Meis-
sen as dukes of Saxony, As a result of the conflict between
Johann Friedrich I and Emperor Karl V (see Ernestine Line), the
Albertine Line acquired the electoral dignity in 1547. The elector
also became King of Poland in 1696 and permanently in 1709.
As a result of the Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815), the elector was
made King of Saxony in 1806, but lost half his territory to Prussia
in 1813. The last king was forced to abdicate at the end of World
War l.</p>

<h2>House of Wettin</h2>
<p>
The House of Wettin is a dynasty of German counts, dukes, prince-electors (Kurfürsten) and kings that once ruled the area of today's German states of Saxony, the Saxon part of Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia for more than 800years and took their name from a castle on the Saale near Halle. The family gained prominence in the 10th century as leaders in the German drive to the east, which made Saxony and Lusatia German. It acquired (c.1100) the margravate of Meissen and soon expanded its domains to include most of Saxony and Thuringia. In 1423, Frederick the Warlike of Meissen was granted Saxony and became (1425) elector of Saxony asFrederickI. The Wettin holdings were repeatedly subdivided.</p>
<p>The most important division (1485) established the Ernestine line and the Albertine line, named for Frederick II's sons Ernest and Albert when they ruled the territories jointly.  Although the older, Ernestine branch remained predominant until 1547 and played an important role in the beginnings of the ProtestantReformation, their predominance ended in the Schmalkaldic War, which pitted the Protestant Schmalkaldic League against Emperor Charles V.</p>

<p>Although itself Protestant, the Albertine branch rallied to the Empire's cause; Charles V rewarded them by forcing the Ernestines to sign away their rights to the Electoral title and lands to the Albertines and thus the electoral title and most ofSaxony passed from the Ernestine to the Albertine line.</p>

<p>In 1603 a division of Ernestine lands occurred when Johann III complied with the demand of his deceased elder brother Frederick William I three sons and the duchy of Saxe- Weimar which was then made up of the region around Weimar and the districts of Altenburg, Gotha and Meiningen was split amongst them with his three nephews receiving the main area around Altenburg while Johann III retained the areas around Weimar andJena for himself.</p>   


<h2>Taler</h2>

 <p>German silver DOLLAR. Name derived from the Joachims thaler GULDENGROSCHEN first coined by the counts of Schlick at Joachimsthal, Bohemia, in 1519. The THALER (GULDENGROSCHEN), first coined at Hall, Tyrol, in 1484, with a gross weight of 31.94 grams 0.939 fine, shrank so that by 1873 when it was discontinued it weighed but 18.4 grams 0.906 fine.</p>
